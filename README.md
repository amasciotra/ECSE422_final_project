THIS CODE RUNS WITH PYTHON 3.7, WILL NOT WORK WITH PYTHON 2

Made with python version 3.7, cannot guarantee full functionality with other versions
of python 3. 

This project takes in an input txt file in the form of the input.txt given, for the
number of cities, and reliabilities and cost of each city to be connected to eachother.

It outputs the solutions if possible to the respective text files as well as printed on the 
console

PartASolution and PartBSolution are the textfile

Follow the instructions from the User interface to use

for Part a) enter a reliability goal between 0 and 1, 

for Part b) enter a cost constraint so that the maximum reliability can be calculated
according to the cost given.
